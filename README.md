# Chicago-Crime-and-Census-Exploratory-Analysis
Exploratory analysis using Chicago crime data and Chicago Census data. The data for these is stored in
an IBM db2 Database which I connected to in Jupyter Notebooks using iPython and queried using SQL magic. 
The goal was to look at the different areas in Chicago and determine if there was a correlation between 
different factors including hardship index, per capita income, and crime rate.
